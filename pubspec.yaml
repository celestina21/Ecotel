# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Nunito Sans
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Nunito-Sans.ttf
          weight: 700

    - family: Arial

        - asset: fonts/Arial.ttf
          weight: 700
  
    - family: Arsenal SC

        - asset: fonts/ArsenalSC-Regular.ttf
          weight: 700
